Leveraged Tableau to craft insightful visualizations from the Kaggle Airbnb listing dataset. This project on Tableau Public showcases a series of interactive and informative visualizations, offering a deep dive into key trends, pricing dynamics, and geographical distribution of Airbnb listings. The diverse set of visualizations not only demonstrates proficiency in data analysis but also provides a valuable resource for anyone interested in understanding patterns within the Airbnb ecosystem.
